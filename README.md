An RPG that teaches javaScript.  Created with node.js and socket.io and Express

I am using node.js to create a simple server that can have multiple connections so more than one person can play at the same time, each 
with their own experiences, but with the ability to play against each other with a couple different options.  They can choose to
play as a noob, with no risk to losing, or they can play with risk of losing a certain percent of their gold, or risk losing everything
to death and respawning at the nearest town.

I plan to include a number of other features.

## How to run

- Make sure you have Node installed.
- Go to root directory and type node app.js in console
- In browser, type localhost:2000
- In the command console at the bottom of the screen type one of the four commands and hit enter.
  - east(number); Pass a number as an argument  
  - west(number); Pass a number as an argument  
  - north(number); Pass a number as an argument  
  - south(number); Pass a number as an argument
